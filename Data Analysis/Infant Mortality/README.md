Exploration of Infant Mortality Data in certain countries

#Dataset Source
World Development Indicators Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/worldbank/world-development-indicators?select=Indicators.csv

#Motivation
It was recently reported on the news that Infant Mortality Rate in the United States is one of the highest in the developed countries. 
I would like to explore infant mortality throughout several years in selected developed countries to find correlation between Infant Mortality Rates and GDP. 
I chose countries with high GDP to have more homogeneous data for analysis.

#Findings
1. Do Infant Mortality Rates tend to reduce in countries with higher GDPs?
Yes, the data shows that countries with higher GDP have lower infant mortality rates. In 6 observed developed countries, mortality numbers go down as countryâ€™s GPD increases.

2. Do Infant Mortality Rates reduce over the years in developed countries?
Fortunately, Infant Mortality Rates have reduced in all observed countries over the years.

3. Does United States indeed have the highest mortality rates among developed countries?
While significant improvements in mortality rates have been observed over the years, United States has the highest rate among other countries in the set.
